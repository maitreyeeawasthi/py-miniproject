Description
This Python script implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows you to play against the computer. In this classic game, both the user and the computer choose one of the three options: "rock," "paper," or "scissors." The winner is determined by the following rules:
*Rock beats Scissors
*Paper beats Rock
*Scissors beats Paper
*The game continues until the user decides to quit by typing "q."

How to Play:
Run the script in a Python environment.
The program will prompt you to enter your choice: "rock," "paper," or "scissors." Type your choice and press Enter.
The computer will randomly select one of the three options as well.
The program will compare the choices and announce the winner: "You won!" if the user wins or "You Lost!" if the computer wins.
The game will keep track of the number of times you win and the number of times the computer wins.
After each round, the program will display the current score (the number of user wins and computer wins).
The game will continue, and you can play as many rounds as you like until you decide to quit by typing "q."
